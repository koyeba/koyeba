## Hi, there 👋 

I'm Al, a software engineer in Paris.

I currently work as frontend software engineer for a **cryptocurrency investment platform**. I am fascinated by tech products that reinvent our daily lives, helping us achieve more in an easier way. Previously, I worked at SoilCloud and Kryptovalley.

Outside of work, i'm passionate about high-performance cars and racing for the adrenaline, watches for their craftsmanship and timeless elegance, and cinema for the powerful emotions that films can convey.
